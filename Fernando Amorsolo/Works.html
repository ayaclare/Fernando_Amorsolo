                        <h1> Master Pieces of Fernando Amorsolo</h1>
                        <p>Fernando Amorsolo painted and sketched more than ten thousand pieces over his lifetime using natural and backlighting techniques. His most known works are of the Dalagang Bukid, landscapes of his Filipino homeland, portraits and WWII war scenes.</p>
                        <p>What truly set him apart from the other painters of his period was the technique he learned and developed from studying the works of Joaquin Sorolla, which involved using sunlight to achieve dramatic contrasts. Despite his Western influences, Amorsolo’s artworks were still inspired by the Philippines. During the Second World War. He painted images of  human suffering in Japanese-occupied Manila. After the war, he continued his landscape paintings and also made portraits of famous personages, most notably of the Philippine Presidents. </p>

                          <h2>Dalagang Bukid (Girl with Banga)</h2>
                          <h3>1937</h3>
                          <h3>Oil on canvas</h3>
                          <h3>24" x 19"</h3>
                          <p>Arguably the most iconic subject in Amorsolo’s body of work is the Filipina woman, as shown in this oil on canvas, Dalagang Bukid. Here, the Philippine provincial lass is shown smiling as she holds a clay jar, a vessel of water that is seen as a symbol of innocence and fragility. This is a reference to the song popularized by National Artist Atang de la Rama in the sarswela “Dalagang Bukid.”</p>

                          <h3>1956</h3>
                          <h3>Oil on canvas</h3>
                          <p>This painting captures the beauty of performing a simple chore, where a woman and her companions are busy at the river washing clothes. One of them has her back turned, bathing. Once again, Amorsolo shows us his masterful technique of using light to show the beauty of the environment.</p>

                          <h2>Fisherman at Sunset</h2>
                          <h3>1955</h3>
                          <h3>Oil on canvas</h3>
                          <p>The orange of dusk paints the sky, clouds colored in soft pastel hues. They serve as the backdrop to the fishermen preparing to set sail in the receding tide for what may be their last trip of the day. Beyond the reclaimed shores, a dark storm gathers, ominously breaking the sunlight and obscuring the seafarers’ way. Nonetheless the men push their boat off the sandbank. We see here then the fishermen as embodiments of determination – indomitable spirits charging forward in spite of the storms of circumstance.</p>
